# ROAR-NET API Specification

This repository contains the ROAR-NET API Specification. For more
information about the specification see the introduction in
[src/README.md](./src/README.md).

You can find the rendered book at
[https://roar-net.github.io/roar-net-api-spec/](https://roar-net.github.io/roar-net-api-spec/).

**Note**: This specification is still in an early development phase,
and as such no officially released version is available yet.

## Requirements

The specification is built with
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), see the installation
instructions in [their
documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).

## Building

To build the specification run:

```sh
mdbook build
```

This will generate a `book` folder with the html of the specification.

## Development

While writing it can be handy to see your changes, you can use the
following command to serve the book:

```sh
mdbook serve
```

## Acknowledgement

This specification is based upon work from COST Action [Randomised
Optimisation Algorithms Research Network
(ROAR-NET)](https://www.roar-net.eu/), CA22137, supported by COST
(European Cooperation in Science and Technology).
