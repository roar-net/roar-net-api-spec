# ROAR-NET API Specification

## About ROAR-NET API

The ROAR-NET API defines a **framework for black-box optimisation
problem modelling**. It is based on abstractions aimed at unifying
black-box optimisation problems, and on a clear **separation between
problem modelling and randomised optimisation algorithms**. The
resulting standardisation of black-box problem modelling leads to the
following advantages:

- Different optimisation algorithms can operate on the same problem
  model, e.g., branch-and-bound and local-search.
- Different optimisation problems (or models) can be solved by the same
  algorithms.

## Conceptualisation

The goal of this specification is to define a minimal,
programming-language agnostic, interface to the optimisation problems
that a wide variety of **Randomised Optimisation Algorithms (ROAs)** can
use to solve these problems. In doing this, the specification should
facilitate modelling of real life problems that can be solved by a wide
range of algorithms and make it possible to easily benchmark problem
models and ROAs.

The specification defines the **types** and **operations** that have to
be implemented when modelling an optimisation problem in order to allow
supported ROAs to function.

The API specification has the following design principles:

- it is **agnostic of the programming language**.
- it is **agnostic of the programming paradigm**.
- requires implementations of the API to **only store problem-specific
  information**. They must be completely free of any information about
  the optimisation algorithm to be used.

## Supported features

The API supports a broad range of problems and Randomised Optimisation
Algorithms (ROAs).  The current version of the specification covers, but
is not limited to, the following classes of **single-objective**
optimisation problems:

- **combinatorial problems**
- **discrete problems**

Furthermore, it considers the following main algorithmic approaches:

- **Constructive search**: solutions are constructed iteratively. For
  example, by adding a component, or assigning the value of a decision
  variable, on each iteration.
  - Example of algorithms include, backtracking, branch-and-bound,
    greedy algorithms, and GRASP.
  - Some of these algorithms may provide guarantees on the quality of
    the solution.
- **Local search**: solutions are found by modifying feasible
  solutions. For example, by exchanging some components of the solution,
  or changing the value of a decision variable.
  - Examples of algorithms include, first and best improvement local
    search, iterated local search, and simulated annealing.
  - These algorithms typically do not provide a guarantee on the quality
    of the solution found but are usually able to find good
    approximations in a reasonable amount of time.

Extensions to multiple objectives, uncertainty settings, and support for
further algorithms are currently under discussion on the [Github
repository](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-spec),
where everyone is welcome to contribute and propose new ideas.
